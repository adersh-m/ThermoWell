## Authentication Architecture

ThermoWell implements a clear separation between public and authenticated routes.

### Authentication Components

1. **AuthContext**: Manages authentication state across the application
2. **ProtectedRoute**: Checks for authentication before rendering protected pages
3. **PublicLayout**: Layout for public pages without sidebar navigation
4. **LoginPage**: Handles user authentication and redirects
5. **UserService Authentication**: Methods for login, logout, and auth status

### Route Structure

**Public Routes**:
- **Home** (`/`): Landing page with basic information
- **Login** (`/login`): Authentication page

**Protected Routes**:
- Dashboard, Advisories, Health Score, Resources, Tips, Alerts, Settings, Help

### Authentication Flow

1. **Initial Load**:
   - `AuthProvider` checks for auth token in localStorage
   - User profile is loaded for authenticated users

2. **Login Process**:
   - User submits credentials on the login page
   - On success, auth token is saved and user is redirected

3. **Protected Route Access**:
   - `ProtectedRoute` component checks auth status
   - Unauthenticated users are redirected to login
   - Original destination is preserved for post-login redirect

4. **Logout Process**:
   - User logs out via TopBar profile dropdown
   - Auth token is cleared and user is redirected to login

### Security Considerations

- **Token Storage**: Auth tokens in localStorage (would be improved in production)
- **Route Protection**: All sensitive routes wrapped in ProtectedRoute
- **API Security**: Auth token included in API call headers
- **Simulated Authentication**: Currently using simulated auth (would integrate with backend)

## Settings Architecture

ThermoWell implements a multi-page settings structure for better organization and user experience.

### Multi-Page Settings with Sidebar Navigation

```
/settings/ (SettingsLayout.tsx with sidebar)
  ‚îú‚îÄ /profile (ProfileSettings.tsx)
  ‚îú‚îÄ /notifications (NotificationSettings.tsx) 
  ‚îú‚îÄ /security (SecuritySettings.tsx)
  ‚îî‚îÄ /preferences (PreferencesSettings.tsx)
```

### Benefits

1. **Improved Performance**
   - Lazy-loading reduces initial bundle size
   - Only loads content needed for current view
   
2. **Better Maintainability**
   - Each settings area is a focused component
   - Clear separation of concerns
   
3. **Enhanced User Experience**
   - Direct URL access to specific settings sections
   - Deep-linkable URLs for sharing/bookmarking
   - Clean browser history navigation
   
4. **Future Scalability**
   - Easy to add new settings sections
   - Can implement role-based access

## UI Standardization

### Button Standardization

All buttons across ThermoWell follow consistent design patterns and color schemes:

#### Button Classes

1. **Primary Buttons (`btn-primary`)**
   - Blue color scheme (`#2563eb` / `#1d4ed8` on hover)
   - Used for main action buttons and CTAs

2. **Secondary Buttons (`btn-secondary`)**
   - Gray color scheme (`#f3f4f6` / `#e5e7eb` on hover)
   - Used for secondary actions like "Share"

3. **Tertiary Buttons (`btn-tertiary`)**
   - Blue outline with transparent background
   - Used for alternative actions

#### Benefits
- **Visual Consistency**: All buttons share the same visual language
- **Brand Alignment**: Consistent blue color scheme throughout
- **Accessibility**: Proper focus states and contrast ratios
- **Maintainability**: Centralized button styles in CSS classes

### Layout Components

#### TopBar Component
- Language Selection with multi-language support
- Notification Bell with real-time counts
- User Profile menu with account access
- Modern animated dropdowns

#### Sidebar Component
- Icon-based navigation menu
- Active state highlighting
- Mobile responsive design
- React Router integration

## Visual Design

The visual design of ThermoWell is centered around clarity, accessibility, and user engagement. Key elements include:

- **Color Palette**: A consistent and limited color palette to enhance recognition and reduce cognitive load.
- **Typography**: Clear and legible fonts, with a hierarchy that guides the user through the content.
- **Iconography**: Intuitive icons that support text labels and enhance understanding.
- **Spacing and Layout**: Generous spacing and a grid-based layout that adapts to different screen sizes.
- **Data Visualizations**: Intuitive and interactive visualizations for heat data and weather information.

### Design Tokens

Design tokens are used to maintain consistency in design across the application. They include:

- **Color Tokens**: Named colors for primary, secondary, and background colors, as well as semantic colors for heat levels.
- **Spacing Tokens**: Standardized spacing units for margins and paddings.
- **Typography Tokens**: Font sizes, weights, and line heights for consistent text styling.

### Dashboard Visualizations

The dashboard features specialized visualizations to help users understand heat-related data:

- **Temperature Gauge**: Visual representation of current and "feels like" temperatures using color-coded scales.
- **Heat Index Visualizer**: Translates heat index values into risk levels with corresponding recommendations.
- **Interactive Map**: Geographic visualization of heat conditions across regions with color-coded overlays.

For more details, see the [Dashboard Visualizations documentation](./DASHBOARD_VISUALIZATIONS.md).

### Accessibility Considerations

The design adheres to accessibility standards to ensure it is usable by people with a wide range of abilities. This includes:

- Sufficient color contrast between text and background
- Text alternatives for non-text content
- Keyboard navigability and focus management
- Consistent and predictable navigation
