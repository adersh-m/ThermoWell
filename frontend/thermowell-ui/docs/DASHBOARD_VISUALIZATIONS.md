# Dashboard Visualizations

This document describes the visualization components implemented in the ThermoWell dashboard.

## Visualization Components

### 1. Temperature Gauge
The Temperature Gauge provides a visual representation of current temperature and "feels like" temperature, using a color-coded scale to indicate risk levels.

**Features:**
- Gradient color scale reflecting temperature severity
- Visual markers for both actual and perceived temperatures
- Easy-to-read numerical display
- Color-coded indicators that match our heat index system

**Implementation:**
- Component: `TemperatureGauge.tsx`
- Uses CSS variables from our color system to maintain consistency
- Fully responsive design that works on all device sizes
- Accessible with proper contrast and clear visual indicators

### 2. Heat Index Visualizer
The Heat Index Visualizer translates complex heat index values into clear, actionable information with color-coded risk levels.

**Features:**
- Clear display of current heat index value
- Risk level indication (Normal, Caution, Warning, Danger, Extreme)
- Actionable safety recommendations based on risk level
- Visual legend showing the full range of heat index values

**Implementation:**
- Component: `HeatIndexVisualizer.tsx`
- Integrates with our semantic color system for consistent risk indication
- Contextual advice that changes based on the severity level
- Compact design that delivers key information at a glance

### 3. Enhanced Heatwave Map
The Heatwave Map provides a geospatial view of heat conditions across regions, with interactive elements for exploring data.

**Features:**
- Interactive map with selectable regions
- Color-coded heat intensity overlays
- Detailed pop-up information for each region
- Regional safety tips and cooling center information
- Visual legend for interpreting heat levels

**Implementation:**
- Component: `HeatwaveMap.tsx`
- Built on React-Leaflet for interactive mapping capabilities
- Custom markers and overlays to visualize heat intensity
- Responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes
- Provides contextual information based on selected region

## Design Principles

All visualizations adhere to the following design principles:

1. **Color Consistency**: Uses the established color system with semantic meaning for heat levels
2. **Visual Hierarchy**: Most important information is most prominent
3. **Accessibility**: Clear contrast, readable text, and intuitive visual cues
4. **Actionable Information**: Each visualization provides context and recommendations
5. **Responsive Design**: All components adapt to different screen sizes

## Future Enhancements

Planned enhancements for future iterations:

1. **Time Series Visualization**: Show temperature trends over time with predictive forecasting
2. **Humidity and Heat Index Correlation**: Visual representation of how humidity affects perceived temperature
3. **Interactive Heat Map**: Allow users to view historical heat patterns by date range
4. **Personalized Risk Assessment**: Visualize risk levels based on user health profile
5. **Geospatial Alert Visualization**: Map-based visualization of active heat-related alerts

## Technical Implementation

All visualization components use:
- React functional components with TypeScript for type safety
- CSS variables from our color system for consistency
- SVG-based visuals for crisp display at any resolution
- Responsive design principles for cross-device compatibility

## Usage Examples

```tsx
// Temperature Gauge
<TemperatureGauge 
  temperature={41} 
  feelsLike={44} 
  minTemp={20}
  maxTemp={50}
  unit="Â°C"
/>

// Heat Index Visualizer
<HeatIndexVisualizer 
  heatIndex={44} 
  showLegend={true}
  showAdvice={true}
/>

// Heatwave Map
<HeatwaveMap 
  onRegionChange={setSelectedRegion} 
/>
```
